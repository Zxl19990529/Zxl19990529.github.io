abstract: >-
 Previous methods online-trained classification branch to provide pseudo annotations for supervising the segmentation branch, which makes the classification branch dominate the whole concurrent training process. We propose a bidirectional supervision mechanism to achieve mutual promotion for End2End weakly supervised semantic segmentation field.
